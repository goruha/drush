Description: include a index.html file
 upstream doesn't provide an index.html file for all the *.html
 documentation provided.
 .
 they currently do not feel confortable maintaining such a file so we
 maintain our own.
 .
 some other changes may creep up in the debian package that I forget
 to document here. a good way to track those changes is to inspect the
 git history, using the following commands:
 .
 git clone http://git.drupal.org/project/drush.git
 cd drush
 git checkout debian
 git diff --stat origin/upstream # identify the modified files
 git log <file> # show the commit logs on that file
 git blame <file> # if the commit can't be found, locate the modified lines from the diff above...
 git show <commit> # ... and display the relevant commit
