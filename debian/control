Description: command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal
 drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal, a
 veritable Swiss Army knife designed to make life easier for those of us
 who spend some of our working hours hacking away at the command prompt.
 .
 Drush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code
 like modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes
 sql queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear
 cache.
