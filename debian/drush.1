.SH NAME
drush \- shell scripting interface for Drupal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B drush
.RI [ options ] " command" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBdrush\fP is a veritable Swiss Army knife designed to make life
easier for those of us who spend some of our working hours hacking
away at the command prompt.
.PP
\fBDrush\fP core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with
code like modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php,
executes sql queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run
cron or clear cache.

If you get tired of typing options all the time, you can add them to
your drush.php alias or create a drushrc.php file. These provide
additional options for your drush call. They provide great flexibility
for a multi-site installation, for example. See example.drushrc.php.

This manual only lists a few of the most frequently used builtin
commands shipped with the Drush core, since other Drupal modules and
third-party "command files" may extend this list significantly. The
canonical source of information for the available commands and their
usage is the online help system.
.PP
More information on each command is also available through \fBdrush
help <command>\fP. Most commands have shortcuts indicated in
parenthesis.

.SH AUTHOR
Drush was originally developed by Arto for Drupal 4.7 (this alpha code
can still be found in the DRUPAL-4-7 branch). In May 2007, it was
partly rewritten and redesigned for Drupal 5 by frando. Since 2008,
the module has been maintained by Moshe Weitzman, Owen Barton and
Adrian Rossouw.
